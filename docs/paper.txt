Description of problem and hypothesis 
    - interested in how challenjour players compare in comparison to pro players

    - how do player stats in game adhere to the meta?
    - do pro players adhere to the meta as much as challenger players do?
    - how does gameplay across different roles compare?

    i expect to see that meta does exist, as there is a general consensus that it does exist. i also expect to see a clear divide between roles because 
    of the different roles that each player abides to, with more variation in pro play as their teamwork should generally be more solid in comparison to 
    players who aren't always 5-manning together, seamless, whatever teamwork yes which allows them to deviate out of the norm to outplay others. but, the
    way that i'm thinking could just be as a low-elo player, and challenger players are just as capable of executing a solid teamwork formation as pros. 
    who knows buddy. 

Detailed description your data set
    - found on kaggle, used to extract all the pro games
    - found on kaggle, used to extract all the challenjour games

    from the extraction of gameids, i ran it through rito's api and had to manually create the csvs to be processed into stats. 

Description of your dataset and how it was obtained 
    Some basic statistics (# of rows, some aggregates)
    - [TODO]
    What did you learn in the initial data exploration phase? How did you decide what features to use in your analysis? Description of any pre-processing steps you took
    - learned that a lot of the data that i assumed to be complete and accessible wasn't actually
        - ended up having to scrap most of the data from that stats online
        - had to manually interact with riot api to write csvs for data that didn't exist
    - ended up hindering my exploration and wasn't able to explore the problem as deeply as i wished that i could 

Detailed description your models
    Describe what kinds of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms you used
    - clustering
    - probably should have used knn, if i wanted to do what i actually wanted to do and classify players but. for the purposes of what i decided 
    on looking for this time i guess this kinda works lul

    How did you validate your models?
    - external clustering validation; compare top/top players and ensure that most of same role are in the same cluster

    What other models did you consider, and why didn't you proceed with those?
    - considered filling in empty data with logistical regression, but ultimately didn't have time
        - using averages was good enough for this purpose   
    - entire exploration is about looking at differences in properties of data, so does not make sense to do much else

    **Some suggested keywords are regression, classification, recommendations, cross-validation, overfitting, etc.

What business applications do your findings have?
- perhaps normal players could try to craft teams off of comparisons to pro-teams off of this
- perhaps pro teams trying to fill the retiration of one member could use something like this to find a new member based on their overall stats
